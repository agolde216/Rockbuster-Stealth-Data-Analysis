Rockbuster Data Analysis Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. I used SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments have.  
  
Key Questions and Objectives  
  
Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?  
  
What is the average rental duration for all videos?  
  
Which countries have the most Rockbuster customers ?
